**Functionality** | | Completes iteration 3 | | |
**Ruby Syntax** | | | | |
**Ruby Conventions** | | Code is properly indented and spaced. Class, method, and variable names follow convention. Lines of code are less than 80 characters. Implements at least one helper method.| | |
**Testing** | | Every class has a test suite with tests that accurately verify the expected behavior of the majority of methods. | | |
**Version Control** | | Code is hosted on master of Github repository. At least 20 commits. At least 1 pull request. | | |
