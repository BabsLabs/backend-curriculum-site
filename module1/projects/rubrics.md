### Week 1: Flashcards (Independent)

<br> | **4: Well Above Expectations** | **3: Meets Expectations** | **2: Below Expectations** | **1: Well Below Expectations**
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | Application is robust and can handle a variety of inputs including invalid inputs and completes iteration 4 | Application adheres to the flow outlined in the specification and can handle a variety of valid inputs implied from the specification. | Application does follow the flow outlined in the specification or can only handle the exact inputs defined in the specification | Iteration 2 is not complete |
**Ruby Mechanics** | Project includes appropriate uses of hashes and enumerables not covered in class | Appropriately uses Ruby's built in datatypes and methods, flow control, and enumerables. | Does not appropriately use one or two of the following: Ruby's built in datatypes and methods, flow control, and enumerables | Does not appropriately use Ruby's built in datatypes and methods, flow control, and enumerables, or does not build classes |
**Ruby Conventions** | Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose | Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention | Code demonstrates some proper indenting and spacing. Class, method, variable, and file names inconsistently follow convention | Code is not properly indented and spaced and lines are excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names do not follow convention |
**Testing** | | Every method listed in the spec is tested. Tests are mostly written to accurately verified expected behavior. | Every method listed.| |
**Version Control** | | Code is hosted on master of Github repository. At least 20 commits. At least 1 pull request. | | |

## Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
