## Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
* Host code on Github

<br>

<br> | **1: Below Expectations** | **2: Passing with Concern** | **3: Passing** | **4: Exceptional** |
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | Turn class is complete |  Deck class is complete | Iteration 3 is complete | Application is robust and can handle invalid inputs and completes iteration 4 |
**Ruby Conventions** | Code is not properly indented and spaced and lines are excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names do not follow convention | Code demonstrates some proper indenting and spacing. Class, method, variable, and file names inconsistently follow convention | Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention | Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose
**Testing** | Every method for the Turn class is tested accurately | Each class has its own test file. Every method for the Deck class is tested. 1 or 2 of those tests may not accurately verify expected behavior | Every method for the Round class is tested. 2 or 3 of those tests may not accurately verify expected behavior. | All the functionality from iterations 1 and 2 is accurately tested and there are no extraneous tests |
**Version Control**  | Code is hosted on Github. 1 - 5 commits | 6 - 20 commits | 20 or more commits and 1 or more pull requests | 30 or more commits and 3 or more pull requests. Commit messages and Pull Request documentation clearly indicate changes made. |
